 Agents

Smolagents is an experimental API which is subject to change at any time. Results returned by the agents can vary as the APIs or underlying models are prone to change.

To learn more about agents and tools make sure to read the introductory guide. This page contains the API docs for the underlying classes.
Agents

Our agents inherit from MultiStepAgent, which means they can act in multiple steps, each step consisting of one thought, then one tool call and execution. Read more in this conceptual guide.

We provide two types of agents, based on the main Agent class.

    CodeAgent writes its tool calls in Python code (this is the default).
    ToolCallingAgent writes its tool calls in JSON.

Both require arguments model and list of tools tools at initialization.

        Return a boolean indicating whether the final answer is valid.

Agent class that solves the given task step by step, using the ReAct framework: While the objective is not reached, the agent will perform a cycle of action (given by the LLM) and observation (obtained from the environment).
extract_action
< source >

( model_output: strsplit_token: str )

Parameters

model_output (str) — Output of the LLM

    split_token (str) — Separator for the action. Should match the example in the system prompt. 

Parse action from the LLM output
from_dict
< source >

( agent_dict: dict**kwargs ) → MultiStepAgent

Parameters

agent_dict (dict[str, Any]) — Dictionary representation of the agent.

    **kwargs — Additional keyword arguments that will override agent_dict values. 

Returns

MultiStepAgent

Instance of the agent class.

Create agent from a dictionary representation.
from_folder
< source >

( folder: str | pathlib.Path**kwargs )

Parameters

folder (str or Path) — The folder where the agent is saved.

    **kwargs — Additional keyword arguments that will be passed to the agent’s init. 

Loads an agent from a local folder.
from_hub
< source >

( repo_id: strtoken: str | None = Nonetrust_remote_code: bool = False**kwargs )

Parameters

repo_id (str) — The name of the repo on the Hub where your tool is defined.
token (str, optional) — The token to identify you on hf.co. If unset, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface).
trust_remote_code(bool, optional, defaults to False) — This flags marks that you understand the risk of running remote code and that you trust this tool. If not setting this to True, loading the tool from Hub will fail.

    kwargs (additional keyword arguments, optional) — Additional keyword arguments that will be split in two: all arguments relevant to the Hub (such as cache_dir, revision, subfolder) will be used when downloading the files for your agent, and the others will be passed along to its init. 

Loads an agent defined on the Hub.

Loading a tool from the Hub means that you’ll download the tool and execute it locally. ALWAYS inspect the tool you’re downloading before loading it within your runtime, as you would do when installing a package using pip/npm/apt.
initialize_system_prompt
< source >

( )

To be implemented in child classes
interrupt
< source >

( )

Interrupts the agent execution.
provide_final_answer
< source >

( task: strimages: list['PIL.Image.Image'] | None = None ) → str

Parameters

task (str) — Task to perform.

    images (list[PIL.Image.Image], optional) — Image(s) objects. 

Returns

str

Final answer to the task.

Provide the final answer to the task, based on the logs of the agent’s interactions.
push_to_hub

( repo_id: strcommit_message: str = 'Upload agent'private: bool | None = Nonetoken: bool | str | None = Nonecreate_pr: bool = False )

Parameters

repo_id (str) — The name of the repository you want to push to. It should contain your organization name when pushing to a given organization.
commit_message (str, optional, defaults to "Upload agent") — Message to commit while pushing.
private (bool, optional, defaults to None) — Whether to make the repo private. If None, the repo will be public unless the organization’s default is private. This value is ignored if the repo already exists.
token (bool or str, optional) — The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If unset, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface).

    create_pr (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether to create a PR with the uploaded files or directly commit. 

Upload the agent to the Hub.
replay
< source >

Parameters

    detailed (bool, optional) — If True, also displays the memory at each step. Defaults to False. Careful: will increase log length exponentially. Use only for debugging.

Parameters

task (str) — Task to perform.
stream (bool) — Whether to run in streaming mode. If True, returns a generator that yields each step as it is executed. You must iterate over this generator to process the individual steps (e.g., using a for loop or next()). If False, executes all steps internally and returns only the final answer after completion.
reset (bool) — Whether to reset the conversation or keep it going from previous run.
images (list[PIL.Image.Image], optional) — Image(s) objects.
additional_args (dict, optional) — Any other variables that you want to pass to the agent run, for instance images or dataframes. Give them clear names!

    max_steps (int, optional) — Maximum number of steps the agent can take to solve the task. if not provided, will use the agent’s default value. 

Run the agent for the given task.

Example:

from smolagents import CodeAgent
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[])
agent.run("What is the result of 2 power 3.7384?")

save
< source >

( output_dir: str | pathlib.Pathrelative_path: str | None = None )

Parameters

    output_dir (str or Path) — The folder in which you want to save your agent.

    a tools folder containing the logic for each of the tools under tools/{tool_name}.py.
    a managed_agents folder containing the logic for each of the managed agents.
    an agent.json file containing a dictionary representing your agent.

    a requirements.txt containing the names of the modules used by your tool (as detected when inspecting its code)

step
