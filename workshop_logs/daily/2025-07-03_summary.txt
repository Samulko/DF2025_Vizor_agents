Status: completed
Task: can you describe the elements...
Response: The geometry agent is currently tracking 4 Python Script components that define a total of 14 distinct geometric elements, which are beams. These beams are categorized into 'variant A' (triangle-like) and 'variant B' (Z-like) structures. Each beam has a unique ID, type (e.g., green_a, red_b), a cent...

Task: hey can you give me details of all of the componeents?...
Response: The geometry agent is tracking 4 Python3 Script components (component_1, component_2, component_3, component_4). All components have similar input and output structures, typically accepting 'x' and 'y' as generic data inputs and providing 'out' (for script output/errors), 'a', 'b', and 'c' (for rhin...

Response: There are four Python Script components in your canvas. Each component (component_1, component_2, component_3, and component_4) has two generic inputs named 'x' and 'y' (for rhinoscriptsyntax geometry) and four outputs: 'out' for script output/errors, and 'a', 'b', and 'c' which are also generic dat...
