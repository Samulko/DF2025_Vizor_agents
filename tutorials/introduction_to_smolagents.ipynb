    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've learned:\n",
    "- ✅ The difference between CodeAgent and ToolCallingAgent\n",
    "- ✅ How to use built-in tools like WebSearchTool\n",
    "- ✅ How to create custom tools with the @tool decorator\n",
    "- ✅ How to build agents that can search for bridge information\n",
    "- ✅ How agents work together in a managed system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for the Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment**: Try creating more specialized tools for your bridge domain\n",
    "2. **Explore**: Look at the geometry agent code to see how it integrates with CAD tools\n",
    "3. **Design**: Think about what other agents might be useful (structural analysis? cost estimation?)\n",
    "4. **Build**: Start working on your own specialized agent for the workshop project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools** are the building blocks - they give agents capabilities\n",
    "- **CodeAgent** is powerful for complex reasoning and calculations\n",
    "- **ToolCallingAgent** is predictable and great for production use\n",
    "- **Managed agents** allow building complex multi-agent systems\n",
    "- Start simple, test often, and build up complexity gradually\n",
