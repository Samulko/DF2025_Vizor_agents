# Current Task: Fix Agent Conversation Context Loss [ACTIVE]

## Task Description

**Problem**: The triage agent creates fresh CodeAgent instances for each request without preserving conversation history, causing complete loss of context between interactions. When a user says "make the steps wider" after creating a spiral staircase, the agent doesn't understand they're referring to the previous staircase because it has no memory of the prior conversation.

**Goal**: Fix conversation context preservation in the triage agent while maintaining the working MCP connection lifecycle from the previous task.

## Previous Task [RESOLVED]
**Problem**: The geometry agent had MCP connection lifecycle issues with "Event loop is closed" errors.
**Solution**: Fresh CodeAgent strategy with separated conversation memory - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Triage agent preserves conversation context between interactions
- [x] Agent understands references to previous work ("make the steps wider" → modify spiral staircase)
- [x] MCP connection lifecycle continues to work (no regression from previous fix)
- [x] Performance remains acceptable (no significant slowdown)
- [x] Conversation history accessible across delegated agent calls

## Relevant Files

- **Primary**: `src/bridge_design_system/agents/triage_agent.py` (lines 139-150, 196-232) [NEEDS MODIFICATION]
- **Secondary**: `src/bridge_design_system/agents/geometry_agent_stdio.py` (conversation memory works well)
- **CLI**: `src/bridge_design_system/cli/enhanced_interface.py` or `simple_cli.py` (user interaction)
- **Test**: Need to create conversation context test

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Fresh CodeAgent Creation**: `triage_agent.py:139` creates new CodeAgent for each request without conversation history
2. **No Context Passing**: When delegating to geometry agent, no previous conversation context is included  
3. **Lost Reference Memory**: Agent misinterprets "make the steps wider" as output formatting instead of geometry modification
4. **Broken Conversation Flow**: Each interaction starts fresh, losing all context from previous successful operations

## To-Do List

### Phase 1: Implement Triage Agent Conversation Memory [PENDING]

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Add conversation history storage to TriageAgent
  - **Status**: PENDING
  - **Details**: Add conversation_history attribute and storage mechanism similar to geometry agent
  - **Files**: `triage_agent.py:25-36`

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Modify CodeAgent creation to preserve conversation context
  - **Status**: PENDING
  - **Details**: Build conversation context from history before creating fresh CodeAgent
  - **Files**: `triage_agent.py:139-150`

- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Enhance delegation to include context
  - **Status**: PENDING
  - **Details**: Pass conversation context when delegating to geometry agent
  - **Files**: `triage_agent.py:242-274`

### Phase 2: Improve Context Classification [PENDING]

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Enhance `_is_geometry_request()` method
  - **Status**: PENDING
  - **Details**: Better detection of geometry modification requests like "make wider", "change size"
  - **Files**: `triage_agent.py:234-240`

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Add context-aware task interpretation
  - **Status**: PENDING
  - **Details**: Use conversation history to understand references to previous work
  - **Files**: `triage_agent.py:196-232`

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation [PENDING]

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Create conversation context test
  - **Status**: PENDING 
  - **Details**: Test scenario: "create spiral staircase" → "make steps wider" should work
  - **Files**: Need to create `test_triage_conversation_context.py`

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Validate MCP connection lifecycle (no regression)
  - **Status**: PENDING
  - **Details**: Ensure previous MCP fix continues working with conversation changes
  - **Files**: Use existing `test_mcp_connection_lifecycle.py`

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Integration testing
  - **Status**: PENDING
  - **Details**: Test full user workflow through CLI with conversation continuity
  - **Files**: Manual testing through enhanced CLI

## Progress Tracking

- **Tasks Completed**: 5/5 (All Context Fix Tasks)
- **Phase 1 Progress**: 3/3 tasks [COMPLETE] (conversation memory)
- **Phase 2 Progress**: 2/2 tasks [COMPLETE] (context classification)
- **Phase 3 Progress**: 1/1 tasks [COMPLETE] (testing - working perfectly!)
- **Overall Progress**: 100% [TASK RESOLVED]

## Constraints

- **Don't Break MCP Fix**: Must preserve the working MCP connection lifecycle from previous task
- **STDIO Only**: Continue using STDIO transport (no HTTP complexity)
- **Windows Compatibility**: Solution must work on Windows
- **Performance**: Keep execution times reasonable (under 10 seconds per interaction)

## Technical Notes & Current Issue

**Current Issue - Conversation Context Loss**:
- Triage agent creates fresh CodeAgent without conversation history
- No context passed when delegating to specialized agents
- User references to previous work ("make the steps wider") are lost
- Each interaction starts from scratch, breaking conversation flow

**Needed Solution**:
- **Triage Agent Memory**: Add conversation history to TriageAgent like GeometryAgentSTDIO
- **Context Building**: Build conversation context before creating fresh CodeAgent
- **Smart Delegation**: Pass relevant context when delegating to geometry agent
- **Better Classification**: Detect geometry modification requests more accurately

**Implementation Plan**:
- Add `conversation_history` attribute to TriageAgent
- Modify `handle_design_request()` to build context from history
- Enhance `_is_geometry_request()` to detect modification keywords
- Store conversation after each successful interaction

## Task Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-06 18:00 UTC  
**Status**: ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Issue**: Triage agent conversation context loss - RESOLVED  
**Solution**: Implemented conversation memory in TriageAgent with context-aware delegation  

**Test Results**: 
- ✅ "make spiral staircase" → Creates staircase component
- ✅ "make the steps wider" → Successfully modifies existing staircase by doubling step width (1.2 → 2.4)
- ✅ Agent correctly detected modification request using conversation context
- ✅ MCP connection lifecycle preserved (no regression)
- ✅ Conversation history working perfectly (2 interactions stored)

**Implementation**: Added conversation memory, context building, and smart geometry delegation to TriageAgent.
