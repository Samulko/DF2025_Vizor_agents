# **Implementation Plan: Creating an Autonomous SysLogic Agent**

## **CORE OBJECTIVE**

Create a new **SysLogic Agent** that validates structural integrity of truss systems, following smolagents' principle of simplicity while maintaining its own memory and state as an autonomous agent.

## **🔍 CURRENT REALITY CHECK**

### **What the System Currently Has**
- **Triage Agent**: Manager that delegates to specialized agents
- **Geometry Agent**: Autonomous agent with MCP integration and internal state management
- **Missing**: Structural validation capability for checking beam connections, orientations, and providing fixes

### **What the SysLogic Agent Will Provide**
- Autonomous structural validation with its own memory
- Clear separation of concerns - purely focused on structural logic
- Integration-ready as a managed agent for the triage system
- Grasshopper fix generation for geometry issues

## **📋 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Focus: Build a Clean, Autonomous Structural Validator**

Following the proven patterns from existing agents:

1. **Autonomous Agent with Memory** - Like geometry agent, it manages its own state
2. **Simple Tool Implementation** - 4 focused validation tools using `@tool` decorator
3. **Factory Pattern** - Clean `create_syslogic_agent()` function
4. **Native Integration** - Ready to be added to triage's `managed_agents`

## **🛠️ DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN**

### **Phase 1: Core Agent Structure**

Create `src/bridge_design_system/agents/syslogic_agent_smolagents.py`:

```python
# Key components:
1. Import necessary smolagents classes (CodeAgent, tool)
2. Implement 4 validation tools:
   - check_element_connectivity(elements: list) -> dict
   - generate_grasshopper_fix(issue_type: str, element_data: dict, correction_data: dict) -> dict
   - calculate_closure_correction(elements: list, module_type: str) -> dict
   - validate_planar_orientation(elements: list) -> dict
3. Create factory function create_syslogic_agent()
4. Load system prompt from system_prompts/SysLogic_agent.md
```

### **Phase 2: Tool Implementation Details**

Each tool will be simple and focused:
- Pure Python validation logic
- Clear input/output contracts
- Detailed docstrings for LLM understanding
- Return structured data for agent reasoning

### **Phase 3: Integration with Triage System**

Update `triage_agent_smolagents.py`:
```python
# In create_triage_system():
syslogic_agent = create_syslogic_agent()
managed_agents = [geometry_agent, syslogic_agent]
```

## **🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **What Success Looks Like**

1. ✅ **Clean Code** - Single-purpose agent file under 300 lines
2. ✅ **Autonomous Operation** - Manages its own validation history
3. ✅ **Clear Integration** - Works seamlessly as managed agent
4. ✅ **Focused Tools** - Each tool does one thing well

### **What This Enables**

- Structural validation without geometry agent involvement
- Clear fix instructions for geometry modifications
- Separation of geometry creation from structural validation
- Future extensibility for more complex structural rules

## **🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### **Step 0: Research Latest Smolagents Best Practices (Est: 30 min) ✅ COMPLETED**
1. **Use Context7 MCP** to retrieve latest smolagents documentation

This refined implementation creates a **physically accurate**, autonomous agent that complements the existing system perfectly. The refinements based on user feedback ensure:

1. **Realistic Engineering**: Accounts for actual 5x5mm beam cross-sections
2. **Clear Communication**: Provides instructions to Geometry Agent, not raw code
3. **Simplified Focus**: Concentrates on well-defined triangular modules
4. **Smolagents Principles**: Maintains simplicity while adding accuracy

The agent is now ready for testing with real truss structures and provides a solid foundation for structural validation in the bridge design workflow.
