# Commit Plan

## Summary of Changes

This commit implements a clean MCP integration using smolagents' native support, fixing persistent async/sync conflicts and local dependency issues.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Custom Sync Wrappers
- Deleted `src/bridge_design_system/mcp/sync_mcp_tools.py`
- Deleted `src/bridge_design_system/mcp/smolagents_integration.py`
- These were causing async/sync conflicts

### 2. Added Clean MCP Implementation
- `src/bridge_design_system/mcp/mcp_tools_utils.py` - Utility for loading MCP tools at app level
- `src/bridge_design_system/mcp/fastmcp_server_clean.py` - Simplified FastMCP server
- Multiple server implementations for fallback options

### 3. Refactored Geometry Agent
- Updated to standard smolagents agent pattern
- Accepts MCP tools as constructor parameter
- No longer manages MCP connections internally

### 4. Fixed Local Dependency Installation
- Added `reference/README.md` for grasshopper-mcp package
- Updated `reference/pyproject.toml` to include fastmcp dependency
- Added grasshopper-mcp as local dependency in main `pyproject.toml`
- Used uv sources configuration for proper editable install

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Updated CLAUDE.md with resolved status
- Added MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with detailed technical docs
- Updated various README files

## Commit Message

```
feat: implement clean MCP integration with smolagents native support

- Remove custom sync wrappers causing async/sync conflicts
- Add mcp_tools_utils for loading MCP tools at application level
- Refactor geometry agent to standard pattern accepting MCP tools
- Fix grasshopper-mcp local dependency installation
- Add comprehensive MCP implementation documentation

This resolves the persistent "Event loop is closed" and "No pyvenv.cfg" 
errors by using smolagents' built-in MCP support and proper package setup.
