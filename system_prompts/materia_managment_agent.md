Material Management Agent - Implementation Manual
Overview
A simple, robust material management system using smolagents that actually benefits from AI reasoning for cutting optimization and waste reduction.
Why This Makes Sense with AI

Optimization decisions: Finding best pieces to cut from
Waste minimization: Intelligent selection to avoid creating unusable pieces
Batch planning: Optimizing multiple cuts across inventory
Natural language interface: "I need pieces of 45cm and 30cm"

Installation
bashpip install smolagents litellm
Quick Start
pythonfrom material_agent import MaterialManagementAgent

# Initialize with your preferred LLM
agent = MaterialManagementAgent(
    model_id="gpt-4o-mini",  # or "gpt-3.5-turbo", "deepseek/deepseek-chat"
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Make requests in natural language
response = agent.process_request(
    "I need to cut a 45cm piece. What's the best approach?"
)
print(response)
Core Features
1. Inventory Tracking (Simple & In-Memory)

Starts with 25 pieces of 100cm each
No database needed - uses simple dictionary
Tracks cuts and remaining lengths
Handles up to 200 pieces easily

2. Intelligent Cutting
The agent provides smart recommendations:
python# Instead of randomly picking, it finds optimal pieces
"I need 35cm" → "Use piece_7 (100cm) - leaves 65cm usable remainder"
"I need 95cm" → "Use piece_12 (100cm) - leaves only 5cm waste"
3. Batch Optimization
Handles multiple cuts efficiently:
python# The agent creates an optimized plan
"I need: 45cm, 30cm, 25cm, 40cm" → Optimized cutting plan minimizing waste

Example Conversations
Simple Cut Request
User: "I need a 45cm piece"

Agent: Let me find the best piece to cut from...
       [checks inventory]
       [finds piece that minimizes waste]
       Best option: piece_3 (100cm) 
       After cutting 45cm, you'll have 55cm remaining (still usable)
       Shall I proceed with the cut?
Batch Operation
User: "Plan cuts for: 30cm, 45cm, 20cm, 35cm"

Agent: Creating optimized cutting plan...
       [analyzes inventory]
       [optimizes to minimize waste]
       
       Plan:
       1. Cut 45cm from piece_1 (leaves 55cm)
       2. Cut 35cm from piece_2 (leaves 65cm)  
       3. Cut 30cm from piece_3 (leaves 70cm)
       4. Cut 20cm from the 55cm remainder of piece_1
       
       Total waste: 0cm (all remainders are usable)
Configuration
python# Adjust waste threshold (pieces smaller than this are considered waste)
inventory.waste_threshold = 15.0  # Default is 10cm

# Change default material length when adding new pieces
agent.process_request("Add 20 new pieces of 150cm each")
Best Practices

Let the AI reason about optimization

Don't manually specify which piece to cut
Ask for recommendations first


Batch operations when possible

"I need pieces of 30, 45, and 60cm" is better than three separate requests


Monitor utilization

Regularly check stats to understand waste patterns
Reorder when usable inventory drops below threshold



Why This is Better Than the MongoDB Multi-Agent System

Extending the System
Add domain-specific intelligence:
python@tool
def find_pieces_for_project(project_requirements: dict) -> str:
    """Find all pieces needed for a complete project"""
    # Your logic here
    pass

# Add to agent
agent.agent.tools.append(find_pieces_for_project)
Limitations & Scale

In-memory: Data lost on restart (add JSON persistence if needed)
Single-user: No concurrency handling (fine for most use cases)
200 pieces: Performs well up to this scale, beyond that consider indexing

Summary
This implementation uses AI where it actually adds value - making intelligent decisions about material usage and optimization. It's simple enough to understand and modify, yet powerful enough to handle real cutting optimization problems.
